# Data Analysis for Aquaculture Production and Wealth per capita

## Description

This project utilises publicly available datasets from the World Bank to analyse the relationship between aquaculture fish production in kg per capita and GDP per capita in USD.

## Data Sources

The datasets used in this project are sourced from the World Bank's official website and include the following indicators:

- **Aquaculture fish production (metric tons)**: `ER.FSH.AQUA.MT`
- **GDP per capita (USD)**: `NY.GDP.PCAP.CD`
- **Population total**: `SP.POP.TOTL`

- Population Total: [Download CSV](https://api.worldbank.org/v2/en/indicator/SP.POP.TOTL?downloadformat=csv)

The files with aquaculture_analysis_cleaned are the final files used for data analysis and includes aquaculture fish production in kg per capita.
